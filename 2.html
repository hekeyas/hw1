        <h2>Two Forms of Pre-rendering</h2>
        <h4><em>November 8 , 2021</em></h4>
        <h3>Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: <strong>Static Generation</strong> and <strong>Server-side Rendering</strong>. The difference is in <strong>When</strong>strong> it generates the HTML for a page.</h3>
        <li><strong>Static Generation</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at <strong>build time</strong>. The pre-rendered HTML is then <em>reused</em> on each request.</li>
        <li><strong>Server-side Rendering</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on <strong>each request</strong>.</li>
        <h3>Importantly, Next.js lets you <strong>choose</strong> which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.</h3>
