        <h2>When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering</h2>
        <h4><em>November 8 , 2021</em></h4>
        <h3>We recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</h3>
        <p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>
        <li>Marketing pages</li>
        <li>Blog posts</li>
        <li>E-commerce product listings</li>
        <li>Help and documentation</li>
        <h3>You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</h3>
        <h3>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</h3>
        <h3>In that case, you can use <strong >Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</h3>
